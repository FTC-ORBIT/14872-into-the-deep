projects that would help us:
- check and upgrade the Orbit_Auto_Maker ( not working with RoadRunner 1.0 yet, need to check the RRpathGen if we want to update , because the orbit auto maker based on it)
- More organized telemetry - to print and add data in one place (in SubSystemManger.printStates).

practice :
- reprogram the color sensor : simple
- code for collecting (pinch && pumping) : simple
- use LEDS! - turn them on, than use a color sensor, the leds will show the color input form the color sensor.:simple
- use the magneticSensor to stop the elevator\arm\telescope (in Intake).: simple
- learn how to use the potentiometer sensor. would - theoretically -help us solve power problems. : simple-mid
- use multiple cameras in the code ( by Robot states) :mid
- use the logger to log info about the motors. power and pose , than create a graph : mid
- elevator/telescope code alone + reset encoder : mid
- Red detection : mid
- Blue detection : mid
- double arm (זרוע דו מפרקית) :hard
- AutoShoot - automatic shooter by april tags (he see the tag and automatically shoot)+ ability to change aiming angle : hard
- AutoDropPixel - make buckster put pixels automatically  : hard
- use the logger to log the AutoDropPixel / AutoShoot and make graph. : hard
- code for a turret - by vision. : hard
- AutoTurretShoot - mix the rook with the Auto Shoot : hard



add more missions and tasks if you think it needed, feel free - after we done with a project - to delete it form here.
